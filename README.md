Repo for ISS code

If you for some reason have been referred to here you can only pray that we used comments(Ki needs to do that more, most of my code is commented)

otherwise just email me(Ki) @
kiguy2052@gmail.com
or Timo @
diep.timo@gmail.com

(Timo's better than I am)(Ehhhhhh, just email us both)

Notes:
9/28
random_int_biled_change and ISS_Mag_Test should be the same thing, I don't know why we have two copies of it but what ever
File type files(hmmm) can be dragged into a text editor to be viewed/edited
